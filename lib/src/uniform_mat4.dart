/// A utility class to manage the uniform fields of a `mat4` uniform in
/// a shader `.frag` file.
///
/// This class also subclasses the base Mat4 object providing read and write
/// access to the data. Though the data is not fetched from the shader and
/// instead is remembered by the base class which means the data can get out
/// of sync if multiple Mat4 objects are instantiated with the same shader
/// and base offset, or if the shader uniforms are set using other means.
/// If this class is used to manage shader uniform data, then no other
/// mechanisms should be used to modify that uniform data.
///
/// See also:
///
/// * [FragmentShader.setFloat] which can also update the uniform values in
///   the supplied [shader] object.
class UniformMat4 extends Mat4 {
  /// Instantiate a wrapper that will provide column-by-column access to
  /// the mat4 using indexing to provide per-column [UniformVec4] objects,
  /// which also then provide a 2D matrix indexing through the indexing
  /// accessors of the [UniformVec4] class.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  ///    UniformMat4 mat
  ///    // These 2 lines do the same thing.
  ///    mat[0].x = 2.0;   // Sets the x value of the first column
  ///    mat[0][0] = 2.0;  // Sets the upper left corner of the matrix
