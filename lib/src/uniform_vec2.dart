/// A utility class to manage the uniform fields of a `vec2` uniform in
/// a shader `.frag` file.
///
/// This class also subclasses the base Vec2 object providing read and write
/// access to the data. Though the data is not fetched from the shader and
/// instead is remembered by the base class which means the data can get out
/// of sync if multiple UniformVec2 objects are instantiated with the same
/// shader and base offset, or if the shader uniforms are set using other
/// means. If this class is used to manage shader uniform data, then no other
/// mechanisms should be used to modify that uniform data.
///
/// See also:
///
/// * [FragmentShader.setFloat] which can also update the uniform values in
///   the supplied [shader] object.

  /// indicated [FragmentShader] located at the indicated `base`.
